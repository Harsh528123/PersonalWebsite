    description: " You currently are viewing my website :) . I built it using React.js with the bulk of the styling and web layout done using CSS. \n\
    I did use some React libraries for animations so that I could focus on the content and code logic. I implemented the useState hook \n\
    for handling the carousel's data, handling the timeline extra information buttons and for the dark mode and light mode set up. \n\
    For all the colors for dark mode and light mode, I used CSS variables to make life easier. Most of my layout modelling was done in flexbox. "

    description: 'I developed a graph class consisting of an adjacency list and numerous methods using object-oriented design and \n\
    graph algorithms such as BFS and topological sorting. I implemented a C++ program that allows users to create prerequisite \n\
    relationships between their courses and visualize them. One of the numerous methods enables the user to view courses available after a prerequisite course. \n\
    Another method allows whether the user to verify if an exact path line exists or not.'

    description: "My friends and I built a web application allowing users to input a career and province in hopes of predicting their income.\n\
    I implemented a Python program that web scraped Canada's job bank website for pre-tax income. \n\
    I also developed a JavaScript program to calculate post-tax income and display the results on the web application. \n\
    I also got familiar with Flask which really helped me understand APIs a lot better which was useful for my research assistant job \n\
    This project was done during a hackathon and was the very first hackathon we all did :) . "

    description: "I developed a Python program that web scraped financial data on the 25 biggest intraday losing stocks. I also implemented \n\
    an AlphaVantage API to retrieve data on each stock's most recent % change in quarterly income. Then I parsed the JSON data and created \n\
    tables on SQLite with data on ticker symbols, names, % change in income, sectors, and % price change."
